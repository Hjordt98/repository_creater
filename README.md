# Repository Creater

This repository allows you to input a string, after which the program replaces all spaces with underscores _. Then it creates a folder somewhere you define using a variable. Afterwards, it creates a README.md file in the folder, and runs a git init to initialize the project as a Git project.


If you wish to run the application from a CLI like git bash simply run the run.py with the following command:

```
python run.py
```
